            <p>
                Hi! I'm <b>Anuvansh Gundev</b>, a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science & Engineering at <b>Delhi Technological University (DTU)</b>. I specialize in building full stack web applications and applying machine learning to solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've interned at the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), where I worked on enhancing and modernizing the ui of web applications, and at OEA DTU (Lab On Wheels), where I contributed by teaching basic computer applications to underprivileged students of Delhi Govt Schools. <br>
                Through building projects with technologies like the MERN stack, Flask, and various machine learning libraries, I’ve gained hands-on experience in designing scalable applications, integrating intelligent features, and bridging the gap between backend systems and user-facing solutions. This journey has strengthened my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver impactful, end-to-end deployed products.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                With 500+ coding problems solved and experience as a national hackathon finalist, I thrive on tackling complex challenges in both software engineering and data science. I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and build technology that makes a meaningful impact. Currently, I am looking for internship and placement opportunities in the tech industry. <br>
                </p>
